	$ cat /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/standard.conf
	listener 1883
	protocol mqtt
	allow_anonymous true

	$ sudo systemctl restart mosquitto.service


Working without username and password:
	mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.29.32 -t "outTopic"
	mosquitto_pub -t 'inTopic' -m 'Praveen'

example:
	mosquitto_sub -u username -P password -t newtopic/test -h test.mosquitto.org

MQTT always follows below architecture:

-------      -------      --------
producer ---> Broker ---> Consumer
--------     -------     ---------

127.0.0.1 is always same as your IP address - loopback this will work instead of giving
hardware ip address
